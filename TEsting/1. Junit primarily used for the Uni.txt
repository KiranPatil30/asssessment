1. Junit primarily used for the Unit testing in java, 

2. @TEst annotation is used to indicate a test method in  Junit5

3. B - @BeforeEach annotation in used for the runs before each test method

4. assertEquals() methods is used to compare two values are equal or not

6. if an assertion fails in a Junit tests than test fails

7. Junit 5 introduced the   org.junit.jupiter package

17.  @Display() is used to give a test method a custom name to improve readability

18. @ParameterizedTest annotation  create parameterized tests in JUnit 5 

19 Imporve code reliability is a main benefit of using unit tests

20 assertFalse(list.isEmpty()) checks that the list is not empty
